# More about methods

## Methods definition

### ! methods
Dangerous methods aka: the ones that modify their receiver may be named with ! exclamation mark.

### = methods
Methods that can appear on the left side of an assignment end with an equal sign

ex:
```ruby
def meep=(val)
  @meep = val
end

obj.meep = "hey"
```

### default arguments

You can reference a previous argument

```ruby
def example(word, pad_width=word.length/2)
end
```

## Variable-Length Argument Lists

### Splat operator
Capture multiple arguments into a single parameter (wrapped in an array)

```ruby
def varargs(arg1, *rest)
  "arg1=#{arg1}. rest=#{rest.inspect}"
end

# varargs("one")                 => arg1=one. rest=[]
# varargs("one", "two", "three") => arg1=one. rest=["two", "three"]
```

Sometimes splat its used to specify arguments that are not used by the method but are perhaps used by the corresponding method in a superclass.

```ruby
class Child < Parent
  def do_something(*)
    # our processing
    super
  end
end
```

- You can only have one splat argument by method
- You can't put arguments with default values after the splat operator

### Methods and blocks

If the last parameter in a method definition is prefixed with an ampersand, any block is converted to a Proc object and assigned to the parameter to use the block later.

```ruby
class TaxCalculator
  def initialize(name, &block)
    @name, @block = name, block
  end

  def get_tax(amount)
    "#@name on #{amount} = #{ @block.call(amount) }"
  end
end

tc = TaxCalculator.new("Sales tax") { |amt| amt * 0.075 }
tc.get_tax(100) # => "Sales tax on 100 = 7.5"
```

### Return statements

If you give the return multiple parameters. the method returns them in an array.
You can use parallel assignment to collect this return value:

```ruby
num, square = meth_three
```

### Splat in method calls

Weâ€™ve seen that if you prefix the name of a parameter with an asterisk, multiple arguments
in the call to the method will be passed as an array. Well, the same thing works in reverse.

```ruby
def five(a, b, c, d, e)
  "I was passed #{a} #{b} #{c} #{d} #{e}"
end

five(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
five(1, 2, 3, *["a", "b"]) # => I was passed 1, 2, 3, a, b
```

### Keyword arguments

You can collect any extra hash arguments as a hash parameter, just prefixing the argument list with two asterisks

```ruby
def search(field, genre: nil, duration: 120, **rest)
  p [field, genre, duration, rest ]
end

search(:title, duration: 432, stars: 3, genre: "jazz", tempo: "slow")
# => [:title, "jazz", 432, {:stars=>3, :tempo=>"slow"}]
```
